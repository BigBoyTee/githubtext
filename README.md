Introduction
ParentHub is a community-driven website aimed at reducing waste and helping parents save money. By allowing parents to list items their children no longer use, the platform facilitates the exchange, sale, or donation of these items to other families in need. This not only benefits the environment by promoting reuse but also helps build a supportive community among parents.

 Features
- User Registration and Authentication: Secure user accounts for parents to manage their listings.
- Item Listings: Parents can create, update, and manage listings for items they wish to exchange, sell, or donate.
- Search and Filter: Easy-to-use search and filter functionality to find specific items.
- Messaging System: Internal messaging system for parents to communicate about listed items.
- Review and Rating: System for reviewing and rating transactions to ensure trust and safety.
- Notification System: Alerts and notifications for new messages, offers, and updates on listed items.
